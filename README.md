# ðŸŽ¨ Art Style Classification Project

This repository contains the final submission for the **Art Style Classification** project.  
The model is trained on a dataset of 11 classes (10 known + 1 hidden "UNK" class for evaluation).

## ðŸ“‚ Files in this Repository

- **`notebook12-2.ipynb`**  
  Jupyter Notebook containing the full workflow: data preparation, model training (EfficientNetV2B0), evaluation, and inference.

- **`final.weights (1).h5`**  
  The trained model weights (Keras format, weights-only).  
  Use this file together with the notebook to reproduce predictions.
